# MDIA-1620
A ***cool*** repository for my MDIA 1620 code


**3 aha moments**
1. What is the major and minor upgrade and how it changes the update number
2. Computer doesn't work like human brain
3. I can put ** to make it bold!

**2 things still unclear**
1. What is difference of git between github?
2. Teacher said github is a language, it looks like simulator and code storage? ?? no? also, do we need to memorize all the markdowns? 

**word for how you're feeling**
complex - kinda complicated but kinda excited to learn something cool
