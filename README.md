A ***cool*** repository for my MDIA 1620 code

<h1>Name : Jisoo Jang</h1>

**3. aha moments**
1. What is the major and minor upgrade and how it changes the update number
2. Computer doesn't work like human brain
3. I can put ** to make it bold!

**2. things still unclear**
1. What is difference between github and git?
2. Teacher said github is a language, it looks like simulator and code storage? ?? no? also, do we need to memorize all the markdowns? 

**1. word for how you're feeling**
- I'm excited to learn something cool
